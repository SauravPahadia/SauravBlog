Coined by French philosopher René Girard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our desires are predicated by our social graph, we learn to desire the same types of careers that our peers desire (this is why you’ll see most CS students pursue FAANG jobs, most business students pursue Big 4 jobs, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Antifragile, Taleb discusses how humans &lt;em&gt;“consider the biggest object of any kind that we have seen in our lives or hear about as the largest item that can possibly exist”&lt;/em&gt; - a phenomenon he calls &lt;em&gt;the Lucretius problem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion, if students end up desiring the same career path as their social graph, they won’t fully comprehend/pursue other career possibilities that could exist for them. In that way, we underestimate the “opportunity space” of the world. The # of opportunities outside our social graph is actually far greater than the opportunities inside our social graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why a person will desire the objects a particular peer set desires is because that person wants entry into the peer set. When I was in elementary school, I demanded my parents to buy me Silly Bands - rubber bands shaped like objects - simply because the popular kids were the kids who wore the most Silly Bands. Advertisers understand this part of mimetic theory well - you’re not trying to convince somebody that they want a Modelo, you’re telling them that if they want to be a patriot, an American, the way to gain entry is by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3ZETlgKI3A&quot;&gt;purchasing a Modelo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the tragic elements of mimetic desire is that it induces self-deception: lying to yourself in order to reshape your perceptions, your experience and your identity to be consistent with who you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; you ought to be, not who you actually are.” [2] How many kids have pursued becoming a lawyer, doctor, SWE, or some other prestigious field because that’s what their parents told them was a good job? Paul Graham covers this as well in his essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html&quot;&gt;How To Do What You Love&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you’d like to like.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
