My Key Insights from Mimetic Theory . If our desires are predicated by our social graph, we learn to desire the same types of careers that our peers desire (this is why you’ll see most CS students pursue FAANG jobs, most business students pursue Big 4 jobs, etc). . In Antifragile, Taleb discusses how humans “consider the biggest object of any kind that we have seen in our lives or hear about as the largest item that can possibly exist” - a phenomenon he calls the Lucretius problem. . In a similar fashion, if students end up desiring the same career path as their social graph, they won’t comprehend that any other career possibility can exist for them. In that way, we underestimate the “opportunity space” of the world. The # of opportunities outside our social graph is actually far greater than the opportunities inside our social graph. . .

When I was in elementary school, I demanded my parents to buy me Silly Bands - rubber bands shaped like objects - simply because the popular kids were the kids who wore the most Silly Bands.

Paul Graham covers this as well in his essay How To Do What You Love: “Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you’d like to like.” .
